# Play-Game-Without-Touching-Anything

Yes, you can play a game without even touching any hardware like mouse, keyboard or any game console. This game is a demo to show how you can do that and introduce you with the future of gaming.

My Environment: OS: Windows 10, Python: version 3.6.4 OpenCV: version 3.1.4

How this works:
1. Open any game with only a single control on the press of spacebar (for example, the T-Rex Dinosaur game in google chromme when you are offline)
2. Now run the .py file (it'll open your camera)
3. Place your hand in the box shown in the camera
4. Now if you close your hand the dinosaur will jump (i.e. spacebar is pressed when you close your hand)
5. Keep opening and closing your hand as you do with a normal spacebar to play the game
